    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Manti is a dish made by putting minced meat seasoned with various spices into small pieces of dough and boiling these pieces in water. Manti, which is a part of Turkish cuisine as well as Central Asian cuisine, is also a popular food in the former USSR countries.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups of flour</li>
        <li>1 glass of warm water</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of salt</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>250g minced meat</li>
        <li>1 medium onion</li>
        <li>Half a teaspoon of black pepper</li>
        <li>Half a teaspoon of chili pepper</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
        <li>Garlic yogurt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon mint</li>
        <li>Half a teaspoon of sumac</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Let's add 3 cups of flour and 1 teaspoon of salt to a deep mixing bowl. Let's mix and create a hole in the middle of the flour.</li>
        <li>Let's add 1 egg in the middle and continue mixing.</li>
        <li>While mixing, slowly add 1 cup of warm water.</li>
        <li>Knead until the dough reaches a consistency that is neither too hard nor too soft.</li>
        <li>Cover the dough with stretch film and let it rest.</li>
        <li>While the dough is resting, add 250 grams of low-fat ground meat to a suitable mixing bowl.</li>
        <li>Then add 1 medium-sized onion, half a teaspoon of black pepper, 1 teaspoon of salt, half a teaspoon of chili pepper and mix well.</li>
        <li>Take the dough to the counter that we have sprinkled with flour, knead it and gather the dough. Divide the dough into 3 equal parts.</li>
        <li>Make the dough we have separated into balls. Roll out the balls we have prepared on the counter that we have sprinkled with flour, one by one, with a rolling pin so that they are thicker than yufka.</li>
        <li>Cut the dough we have rolled out into small squares with a knife. Put small pieces of the ground meat mixture we have prepared in the middle of the squares we have cut.</li>
        <li>Bring the 4 corners of the dough together in the middle and give it the shape of manti. Let's gather the manti we shaped on a tray whose bottom we floured and freeze it by putting the tray in the freezer.</li>
        <li>You can store the manti we took from the freezer in double-lock bags to cook later in the freezer. Let's boil water in a suitable pot.</li>
        <li>Let's add the manti we took from the freezer to the water and cook for 15-20 minutes. Let's add 2 tablespoons of butter to a suitable sauce pan, then add 2 tablespoons of tomato paste and mix well.</li>
        <li>Let's add the tomato sauce we prepared to the cooked manti and continue cooking while mixing. Let's put the cooked manti in a deep plate and pour garlic or regular yogurt on it. Our manti recipe is ready. You can serve it by adding red pepper flakes, mint and sumac.</li>
